In this D3-challenge I elected to create a scatter similar to the example given, plotting healthcare % vs % poverty.
Noteworthy is a general positive correlation between increaing poverty% per state and reduced % participation in healthcare.
More information would be needed to extrapolate further.

In creating the scatter plot I leaned on methods used in Lesson 16/D3 as referenced in the code. I also referenced w3 schools and stack overflow for creation of circles and appending text to the circles from the list of state abbreviations. In addition I had some guidance from tutor and reviewed class lectures/office hours.

The goal was to create a scatter representation of poverty vs healthcare participation/access and label the circles by state (abbreviation)
